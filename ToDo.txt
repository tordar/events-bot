How Broadcast works:
Selling a service to different venues. Essentially, a widget that venue website can implement.
The endpoint is "layoutWidgetCors", which a lot of different venues fetch. For some reason it seems to be from the demo.broadcast site.
It seems they use TinyBird as the user-facing platform for events to push new events (maybe)
The new Rockefeller website is built on Broadcast's platform (Aug 24) - what does this mean? It says it makes it possible for them to update
events on their website and on Broadcast in one go. Does that mean other websites need to update their event data on the Broadcast platform themselves?
